Bugs:

[x] make target range from the edge of the target, not the centre of the target.
[x] fix pause menu button positions.
[] Add Achievement Button Game Over Screen.
[] Add Total gold as well as added gold to end screen.

Balance:
[] Remove double spawn rate.
[] Introduce some kind of tier progression - every 5 minutes a new tier.
[] Achievements for getting to different tiers (waves).
[] Normal waves only spawn elites or normals.
[] Tier progression waves spawn a boss.
[] Tier should be 5 mins of gameplay.

New Features:
[] Enemy type that guards chest.
[] Zoom out the more powerful you are.
[] Fire trail enemies.
[] Enemy Type leaving trail that slows.
[] Make enemy that can knock player back.
[] Objectives (stand in circle 10s).
[] Stomping Enemy.
[] Throw Grenade Enemy.
[] Exploding Enemies.
[] Boss enemy that traps you in a smaller area.
