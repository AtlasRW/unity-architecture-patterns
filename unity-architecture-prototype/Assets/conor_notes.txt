Actions:

[] Add Non intrusive tutorial popups on first play through.
[] Increase sword attack speed from 10s to 3s. Reduce upgrades.
[] Add random angle to projectiles for shooters for more variance.
[] Increase Dash font size and change color (green for > 1, otherwise Red) 
[] Wave 4 difficulty reduced.

Notes:

- Need to figure out how to replicate the no pickup bug. 
- Not going to fix anything itch.io or WebGL related for now.

"Who am I? What is my purpose in life?"

Idea: You're a cleaning robot who's been ordered by your masters to sweep the sewers, 
only to discover it's overrun by a horde of sentient slimes. A good robot, 
you aim to accomplish your programmed task by any means necessary.

Conors Playthrough:

* Didn't read anything, hit play
* Could control fine, dash is interesting, no idea how to trigger it. Pressed a bunch of keys 
* Full screen does not make it full screen
* Died on round 3, pink guys are fast
* I started enjoying it more in round 3
* Took -10 health for +1 speed. When I had 10 health. Did not die at 0/10 health. But I died after one other shot. 
* Clicked "Buy item", why would I want to increase the enemy spawn rate? I did anyway
* Not much weapon feedback makes me confused about if I am getting more weapons ever.
* I like the health numbers
* I now know I have multiple weapons
* Not sure, but I don't think I manage to trigger the sword much
* I feel like all the purple guys are getting trapped inside a ring of red guys and I'm never hitting them
* My approach for the purple spitters is to always spin in the same direction forever
* I feel like I've been on wave 3 for 7 minutes
* Finally picked up some green health, I keep missing them
* I love player speed
* I found offered of two things that both had negatives very interesting. Normally I only pick postive things. I thought about this one for 4 times longer. 
* I almost always pick player speed because I am afraid of the pink guys
* I paused the game by clicking out of the window, then only S (down) worked, then I died. Wave 4
* Controls are fine, might be my fault. Maybe pressed up and down at the same time or something
* Bought x2 sword range
* Got an offer of: 0.5 sword knock back, or 1 sword knock back. Not a hard choice
* Pink guys killed me again
* Bought player speed, I will not be killed by the pink guys again 
* OMG, these fucking pink guys, down to two health
* Once you get wave 3 into a lump it is very easy to avoid them
* Died, tried to get a health, to many flying bullets.
* I would like dash feedback
* Holy shit, 26 dashes
* Picked up an item pickup but nothing happened
* I think all the item pickups have stopped
* Didn't want to keep living without item pickups after about 5 minutes
* Who am I? What is my purpose in life? (a joke, but honestly I rarely play games when I don't get told some sort of purpose, but I think that's just me).
* Played for maybe 30-45 minutes, only ever got to level 4
* 424 killed, 12 bosses, 412 gold, 101 chests, 7 dealths, 5838
