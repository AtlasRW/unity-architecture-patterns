# Unity Architecture Patterns

Explore the implementation of various software architecture patterns within the Unity Engine. This project demonstrates how the same game can be developed using different architectural approaches, providing practical insights into their strengths and trade-offs.

## Project Overview

Each architecture pattern is applied to create the same game, allowing for a direct comparison of coding styles, maintainability, scalability, and overall design efficiency. This approach offers a hands-on understanding of how different patterns affect game development in Unity.

## Architectural Patterns

### Spaghetti
The Spaghetti pattern is characterized by its lack of formal structure. Code is often written without clear organization, leading to tangled dependencies and difficulties in maintenance. This pattern is used as a baseline to highlight the advantages of more structured methodologies.

### GameObject-Component
This pattern is central to Unity's design philosophy, emphasizing modularity and reusability. Game objects are built using separate components, each responsible for specific functionalities. This approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and allows for easy iteration and testing of different game behaviors.

### Scriptable Object
Coming Soon

### DOTS ECS

### Reactive Programming (UniRx)
Planned

### IoC Container + MVC (VContainer)
Planned
