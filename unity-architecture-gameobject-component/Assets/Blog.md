Things to cover:

- Namespaces.
- serialized properties.
- don't use regions
- events.
- Unity Events versus Actions
- decoupling UI.
- Single Responsibility Principle.
- no singletons
- no game manager
- testing parts of the game in isolation.
- switch from tags to layers.
- new input system.
- proper prefab usage.
- It's really easy to violate Single Authority.
- Transferring Data between scenes is hard.

Talk about the struggle, almost giving up. Do what's fun.

Spagehtti start fast but slows down.

developmentSpeed = 1 - (0.002f * linesOfCode);

GameObject Component has a large upfront cost, but it's more consistent.

developmentSpeed = 1 - Random.Range(0.3f, 0.7f);

There was more bugs, had to add safety because of events.
